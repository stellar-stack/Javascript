        Sirine Ben Hamida I am a Web Developer with 3 years of experience within
        a startup. During my carrer, I was always looking for a growing company

        to just keep things running as is. To maintain my energy levels high
        during work, I use this formula: Energy = Motivation x Commitment¬≤ (E =
        M.C¬≤)
